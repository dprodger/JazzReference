Contract tests for GET /api/songs/<song_id>/recordings/shell.

Why these tests exist
---------------------
The shell endpoint is half of a shell+hydrate pattern: the iOS/Mac app
loads it to render group headers, apply client-side filters, and show
skeleton rows; it then fills in cover art + full performer data via
GET /api/recordings/batch as rows scroll into view.

The contract here is narrower than the list endpoint's but has the same
brittle failure mode — a drift in the wire shape decodes silently to
``nil`` on the Swift side, which surfaces as "why is my group header
count wrong" or "why is the vocal filter dead" rather than a hard error.

This module pins the contract:

* ``EXPECTED_SHELL_FIELDS`` is the exact set of top-level keys each
  recording in the shell response must carry. Set equality, so additions
  and removals both fail the test.
* ``FORBIDDEN_SHELL_FIELDS`` is an explicit deny-list of "full" payload
  fields that MUST NOT appear on the shell — cover art, full performers
  arrays, community_data jsonb, etc. Catches accidental regressions where
  someone pastes in the full query and forgets to trim.
* A separate test exercises the CTE fall-through path (recording with no
  performers, no releases, no streaming, no community contributions, no
  authority recs) so the shell endpoint stays robust to missing data.
* Two tests cover the happy-path population cases: leader performer
  surfaces as a single-element ``performers`` array, sidemen's instruments
  are included in ``instruments_present`` even though sidemen are not in
  ``performers``.

If you add a field to the shell query, update ``EXPECTED_SHELL_FIELDS``.
If you add a field to ``FORBIDDEN_SHELL_FIELDS`` instead of
``EXPECTED_SHELL_FIELDS`` by mistake, both tests will fail — which is
a clear prompt to pick the right bucket.

Fixture strategy mirrors ``test_song_recordings.py``: deterministic UUIDs
in the ``00000000-0000-4000-8000-…`` range, self-cleaning before + after
every test so a crashed run can't orphan rows.
