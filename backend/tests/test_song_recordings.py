Contract tests for GET /api/songs/<song_id>/recordings.

Why these tests exist
---------------------
This endpoint ships a trimmed payload shape to the iOS/Mac list views. It
has been refactored several times (CTE restructure, field trims), and each
refactor has risked drifting the response shape away from what the clients
expect. The Swift ``Recording`` struct is all-optional, so a missing or
renamed field here decodes to ``nil`` silently — which means problems only
surface as "why is my UI blank" after a ship.

This module pins the contract:

  * ``EXPECTED_LIST_FIELDS`` is the exact set of top-level keys each
    recording in the response must carry. Adding or removing a field here
    is the forcing function: a developer changing the endpoint has to
    consciously edit this constant, which makes them think about whether
    the iOS clients will render correctly with the new shape.
  * Fields are asserted as a *set equality*, not "contains" — so both
    additions and removals are caught.
  * ``DROPPED_LIST_FIELDS`` is a second constant listing fields we
    deliberately stripped from the list payload in favour of the detail
    endpoint carrying them. A redundant assertion by design — it's named
    for grep-ability when the next trim happens.
  * A separate test exercises the CTE fall-through path (recording with
    no releases, no imagery, no streaming, no performers, no community
    data) so that an INNER JOIN sneaking in for any of the pre-computed
    CTEs is caught immediately.

If you add a field to the list query, update ``EXPECTED_LIST_FIELDS``.
If you drop one, move it to ``DROPPED_LIST_FIELDS`` and verify no iOS
row-level view depends on it (detail views re-fetch via
``/api/recordings/<id>``, which carries the full payload).

Fixture strategy
----------------
The tests insert their own song/recordings/performers/releases using a
set of deterministic UUIDs (``00000000-…-0000-000000000001`` etc.) and
delete those specific rows before and after each test. This is compatible
with the existing conftest auth-table cleanup and won't touch data a
developer has locally in the ``jazz_test`` DB.
