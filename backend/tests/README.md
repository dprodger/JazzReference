# Backend tests

Pytest suite for the Flask backend. Currently covers the auth flow; matchers,
research queue, and rate-limit smoke tests are tracked as follow-up issues.

## Running locally

You need a Postgres reachable via the same env vars the app uses
(`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`). Bootstrap a
test database from the schema before the first run:

```bash
createdb jazz_test
psql jazz_test -f sql/jazz-db-schema.sql
for f in sql/migrations/[0-9]*.sql; do psql jazz_test -f "$f" || true; done
```

Install dev deps and run the suite:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=jazz_test \
  DB_USER=$(whoami) DB_PASSWORD='' \
  JWT_SECRET=pytest-test-secret RATELIMIT_ENABLED=false \
  pytest tests/ -v
```

CI runs the equivalent in `.github/workflows/pytest.yml` against a
Postgres `services:` container.

## Conventions

- **Test isolation**: an autouse fixture in `conftest.py` `TRUNCATE`s
  `users`, `refresh_tokens`, and `password_reset_tokens` after every test.
  Don't rely on rows surviving across tests.
- **Email**: `core.email_service.send_*` and the `routes.auth` import-site
  bindings are mocked out by another autouse fixture. No tests can
  accidentally hit SendGrid.
- **Rate limiting**: disabled via `RATELIMIT_ENABLED=false` in the test env.
  Tests that specifically exercise rate-limiter behavior will need to
  re-enable it in their own fixture.
- **External OAuth**: Google / Apple sign-in is not covered yet — both
  require mocking remote JWKS clients and live in a follow-up issue.

## Adding a test

For a route that touches the DB, prefer the `client`/`auth_headers`/`register_user`
fixtures over poking the DB directly. They keep tests tight and behaviour-focused.

For a pure-function module (matchers, parsers, validators), write unit tests
in a new `test_<module>.py` — no DB or `client` needed.
