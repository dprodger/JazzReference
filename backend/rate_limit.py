"""
Rate limiting for authentication and password endpoints.

Provides a module-level ``limiter`` that is initialized against the Flask
app in ``app.py`` and used as a decorator on the endpoints that need it
(see ``routes/auth.py`` and ``routes/password.py``).

Design notes:

- Storage is in-memory by default. The backend runs under gunicorn with
  ``workers = 1`` (see ``gunicorn.conf.py``) so one shared in-memory
  counter is authoritative. If you ever scale to multiple workers or
  multiple instances, set ``RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI=redis://...`` in the
  environment — Flask-Limiter will pick it up automatically and no code
  change is required.

- Rate limits are identified by real client IP. The backend runs behind
  Render's reverse proxy, so ``request.remote_addr`` by itself reports
  the proxy's IP. ``ProxyFix`` is installed in ``app.py`` with
  ``x_for=1`` to rewrite ``remote_addr`` based on the single trusted
  ``X-Forwarded-For`` entry Render writes. Flask-Limiter's default
  ``get_remote_address`` key function then sees the real client IP.

- Limits can be globally disabled by setting ``RATELIMIT_ENABLED=false``
  in the environment. Used for local development, CI, and load tests
  where tight limits would be noise rather than signal. Rate limiting
  is enabled by default in every other environment.

- The ``/auth/change-password`` endpoint is rate-limited per *user*
  (via the access-token subject) rather than per IP, so that a whole
  office behind one NAT can change passwords independently. All other
  endpoints are limited per IP because the caller is unauthenticated
  at the time of the call.
