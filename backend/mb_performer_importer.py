Shared utilities for importing performer and instrument data from MusicBrainz

UPDATED: Recording-Centric Performer Architecture
- Performers are now associated with RECORDINGS (primary)
- release_performers is kept for release-specific credits only (producers, engineers)
- New add_performers_to_recording() method aggregates performers from all releases
- Special logging when adding performers to recordings that already have performers

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (2025-12):
- Batch fetches performer lookups (by MBID and name) in single queries
- Batch fetches existing performer links in single query
- Eliminates per-performer database round trips for "already linked" checks
