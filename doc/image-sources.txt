### üéØ Usage Tips & Best Practices

* **Always check the ‚Äúrights‚Äù or ‚Äúlicense‚Äù field** for each image. Just because a site says ‚Äúfree‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean every single image is free for *all uses*.
* **Check for model or property releases**, especially if a photo shows a still-living person (or their estate may still control rights).
* **Use high-resolution downloads** when possible, especially if you plan print or large-format usage.
* **Keep a record** of the image source, license type, date of download, and any attribution requirement.
* **Attribute when required** (e.g., ‚ÄúPhoto by John Doe / CC BY 4.0‚Äù); even if not required it‚Äôs good practice.
* **For commercial use**, double-check: some images may be ‚Äúfree for non-commercial only‚Äù or have other constraints.
* **Vintage photos (pre-1927 US published)** often are public domain, but international copyright or later estates may complicate things.
* **When in doubt**, reach out to the hosting institution for clarification on rights.

If you like, I can **narrow down to ‚Äúarchival photos of jazz musicians (1930s-1960s)‚Äù specifically** and pull a list of **5‚Äì10 direct image links** already verified for public domain or CC-0 status. Would that be useful?
